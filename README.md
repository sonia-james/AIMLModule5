## **Purpose :** 
Analyse the data given about different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. From the given data figure if a driver would accept the coupon and further provide recommendations for the success of the coupons rollout. 

## **Coffee House Coupons**
### **Inferences :** 

* Drivers who have visited a coffee house more than 1 time and are driving at 10 AM exhibit a significantly high acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
* Drivers traveling with friends show a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
* Drivers aged 21 and below have a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
* Students and healthcare professionals who have visited a coffee house more than 1 time exhibit a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
* Drivers who have visited a coffee house more than 1 time and are traveling with friends show a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
* 1-day expiration coupons have a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
* Gender does not influence the acceptance rate of coffee house coupons.

### **Recommendations and Next Steps :**
* Launch targeted coupon campaigns around 10 AM to capitalize on the high acceptance rate during this time.
* Offer exclusive or loyalty-based coupons for drivers who have visited coffee houses more than once.
* Design referral or group-based incentives for drivers traveling with friends (e.g., "Buy 1 Get 1 Free" or "Group Discount" coupons).
* Run targeted ad campaigns or coupon promotions aimed at drivers aged 21 and below. Leverage platforms where younger audiences are more active (like social media).
* Create special promotions for students and healthcare professionals who are frequent coffee house visitors (e.g., "Student Discounts" or "Healthcare Heroes Specials").
* Avoid customizing coupon offers based on gender, as gender has no impact on acceptance rates.
* Monitor Campaign performance and adapt
